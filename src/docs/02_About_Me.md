# Introduction

Let me quickly tell you about myself. 

My name is Santhosh Balaji Ramesh. Born and brought up in Chennai, India. In 2010, I moved to Germany for my master studies in Electrical Engineering. 

## Work Experience

After completing my masters, started working in field of Industrial Automation. It gave me a first hand opportunity to work with some of the best minds in field and deeper look in the German engineering.

After working for 3 years, with my deep interest for learning new technology, I switched to the field of Manufacturing Execution System MES programming. MES acts as bridge between Operation Technology (process field) and Enterprise Resource Planning ERP Systems. My passion for high level programming langauges got revived.

Since the last 8+ years working in the field of IT-Software üíª development with still having roots in the industrial automation.

Last 4 years, I have been actively involved in digitialization with my current organisation.

## Personal

I currently reside near Frankfurt, Germany. Married and father of 2 beautiful kids.

Swimming üèä, cycling üö≤ and hikking ü•æ are some of my favorite outdoor activities.

## Why Youtube Channel ?

I like to experiment the latest technology software, be it a simple Program to complex DevOps software. Sometimes it is not easy to find the manual or proper guides. 

That is why, I wanted to share the information in simpler terms. Some of the tips and trics on how to install or solvings issues comes handy. Few times I personally have referred to my videos, to resolve certain specific issue.

Most of the content posted here require atleast beginner level understanding.

## How frequent are the vidoes released ? 

Until end of 2023, I had infrequently released videos, owing to personal reasons. Looking ahead 2024, I would like to regularly post content. 

I am always open to new ideas. Feel free to write an e-mail to me. Click [here](mailto:santhosh.mwpa@gmail.com) to connect with me.
