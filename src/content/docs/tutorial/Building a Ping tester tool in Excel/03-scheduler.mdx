In the previous post [here](../02-monitor), we saw how to monitor the ping function.

There is another use case, which requires to execute ping function at a particular time of day.

To perform this function, we extend the monitor capability to setup a scheduler.

## Scheduler function

* Set the time in Excel sheet

```vb title="scheduler.vba"

Sub Set_Schedule_Time()

    ActiveSheet.Range("F15").Value = "Scheduled"
    
    Application.OnTime TimeValue(ActiveSheet.Range("F14").Value), "Ping"
    
End Sub


```

```vb title="reset-scheduler.vba"

Sub Reset_Schedule_Time()

    ActiveSheet.Range("F15").Value = "Not Scheduled"
    
    Application.OnTime EarliestTime:=TimeValue(ActiveSheet.Range("F14").Value), _
        Procedure:="Ping", Schedule:=False
End Sub

```


:::tip

Resetting the values while closing the workbook.

```vb
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
    If Tabelle1.Range("F15").Value = "Scheduled" Then
        Reset_Schedule_Time
        ThisWorkbook.Save
    End If
End Sub
```

Make sure the computer/laptop is connected to the same network and the hostname is known (or entered in the `hosts` file in __**C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts**__ )
