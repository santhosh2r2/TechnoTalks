With this project, I was able to discover multiple aspects of build and deploying a `.net windows forms` project using currently available tools.

Especially covering the following topics

<Steps>
1. Setting a `.net 8` and `unit test` projects

2. `Entity Framework` as a ORM to access the database

3. `xUnit` testing framework

4. `NLog` logging framework

5. `CI/CD` using GITLAB

</Steps>

:::caution
This project is not refactored and especially, the analytics and metric part is left out intentionally. 

Maybe in the future, when I have time, will look into it.
