## Introduction

A shoutout to one my youtube subscriber which made this **article** possible

## Pre requisites

1. Download `plink` exe
   - From the website: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
   - or to download directly, click [here](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/plink.exe)

## Workflow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Excel as Excel Sheet
    participant VBA as VBA Code
    participant Shell as Command Prompt
    participant FileSystem as Temp file for storing result

    Excel->>VBA: Start SshLoginTest()
    VBA->>VBA: Set plinkPath, tempFile, userName, password, hostIp
    VBA->>Excel: Clear range B2:B20

    loop For each IP address in range A2:A20
        VBA->>Excel: Get hostIp, userName, password
        alt Values are available
            VBA->>VBA: Set tempFile path
            VBA->>Shell: Run command (plink) to check SSH login
            VBA->>Shell: Wait for 2 seconds
            VBA->>FileSystem: Read result from tempFile
            alt Login successful
                VBA->>Excel: Set status to "Connection successful" (Green)
                VBA->>Excel: Set timestamp in column C
            else Login failed
                VBA->>Excel: Set status to "Connection failed" (Red)
            end
            VBA->>FileSystem: Delete tempFile
        else Missing values
            VBA->>Excel: Set status to "Missing values" (Custom color)
        end
    end

    Excel->>VBA: End SshLoginTest()
```

## Steps to build

### 1. Column definitions

| Column | Description            | Example                |
| :----: | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
|   A    | Hostname or IP-Address | 192.168.80.142         |
|   B    | Status                 | Connection successfull |
|   C    | Last reachable at      | 29/09/2024 03:00:59 PM |
|   D    | Username               | dev                    |
|   E    | Password               | dev                    |

:::note
Format the Column **E** to mask the password. 

For the press `CTRL+1` or right-click and select `Format cells`.

    `Number` -> `Custom` and enter `;;;**`
:::

### 2. `VBA` code

- Create a sub routine called `SshLoginTest`

    ```vb
    Sub SshLoginTest()

        Dim plinkPath As String, tempFile As String, userName As String, password As String, hostIp As String
        
        'rest of the code

    End Sub
    ```

- Setup the location of the downloaded `plink` 

    ```vb
    'path to plink
    plinkPath = "C:\Temp\plink.exe"

    ```

- Clear the previous results

    ```vb
    'clear the status column
    Range("B2:B20").ClearContents
    ```

- Now loop through the ip-Address

    - Get ip-address, username and password
        ```vb
        'get the ip-address, username, password
        hostIp = Trim(ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value)
        userName = Trim(ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 4).Value)
        password = Trim(ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 5).Value)
        ```
    
    - Make sure that all three variables are available and are not empty.
        ```vb
        hostIp <> "" And userName <> "" And password <> ""

        else

        'if values are missing in the columns
        ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Value = "Missing either ip-address, username or password value"
        ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Font.Color = RGB(154, 88, 99)
        ```
    
    - Set the `temp` file location
        ```vb
        'temporary file to store plink result
        tempFile = Environ$("TEMP") & "\plink_result_" & hostIp & ".txt"
        ```
    
    - The `command` for the testing the ssh-login
        ```vb
        'command to check for ssh login
        Command = "cmd /c " & plinkPath & " -ssh " & hostIp & " -l " & userName & " -pw " & password & " -batch echo connection successfull exit > " & tempFile
        ```
    
    - Create a shell and execute the command
        ```vb
        'run the command in shell, without window frame
        Set objShell = CreateObject("wscript.shell")
        returnCode = objShell.Run(Command, 0, True)
        
        'wait a bit for the command to complete
        Application.Wait (Now + TimeValue("00:00:02"))
        ```
    
    - Evaluate the result
        ```vb
        'if login successfull, then the "connection successufull" test is checked
        If InStr(result, "successfull") > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Value = "Connection successful"
            ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Font.Color = vbGreen
            ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 3).Value = Now
        Else
            ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Value = "Connection failed"
            ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 2).Font.Color = vbRed
        End If
        ```
    - It is possible that the host server is not known to the machine for the first time.

        ![unknown_host](./img/09/2.png)

        - Verify if the host exists in the `Registry editor` (**regedit**)
            ![registered_hosts](./img/09/3.png)
        
        - To solve this issue, the host needs to be added to the `ssh cache`. Using the following command, without adding the `-batch` flag.
            ```vb
            'command to add host key to cache on first connection attempt
            Command = "cmd /c echo y | " & plinkPath & " -ssh " & hostIp & " -l " & userName & " -pw " & password & " echo connection successful > " & tempFile

            'run the command in shell, without window frame to add host key
            Set objShell = CreateObject("wscript.shell")
            returnCode = objShell.Run(Command, 0, True)
            ```
