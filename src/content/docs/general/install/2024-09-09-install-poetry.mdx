## Introduction

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. 
It offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution.

<Aside type="note" title="Info">
`Poetry` is comparable to `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` in the **NodeJS** world.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Attention">
`Poetry` should always be installed in a dedicated virtual environment to isolate it from the rest of the system. It should in no case be installed in the environment of the project that is to be managed by Poetry. This ensures that Poetry's own dependencies will not be accidentally upgraded or uninstalled.

Below are the instructions for Ubuntu. Complete instructions list for other methods here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer

Install `pyenv` to manage python versions. Here is the complete [source]()
</summary>
<Steps>
1. Installing via the recommended way

    ```sh frame="none"
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```

2. Setup shell environment by adding the commands to the `.bashrc`

    ```sh frame="none"
    echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Restart shell

    ```sh frame="none"
    exec "$SHELL"
    ```

4. (optional) Build environment for `Python`

    ```sh frame="none"
    sudo apt update;  sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl git \
    libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
    ```

4. Install a python version

    ```sh frame="none"
    pyenv install -l  # gives the list of all available versions
    ```

    ```sh frame="none"
    pyenv install 3.12 # install the selected version
    ```

5. Set the version

    ```sh frame="none"
    pyenv global 3.12 # setting the python environment
    ```

6. Uninstall python version

    ```sh frame="none"
    pyenv uninstall 3.12 # removes this version
    ```

7. (optional) Update `pyenv`
    ```sh frame="none"
    pyenv update
    ```

7. (optional) Uninstall `pyenv`: To completely uninstall Pyenv, **remove all Pyenv configuration lines from your shell startup configuration**, and then remove its root directory. This will delete all Python versions that were installed under the `$(pyenv root)/versions/ directory`:

    ```sh frame="none"
    rm -rf $(pyenv root)
    ```

### Instructions for `poetry` installation
<Steps>
1. Download the **Poetry** install script and execute

    ```bash frame="none"
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

2. Add **Poetry** to `Path`
    
    The installer creates a poetry wrapper in a well-known, platform-specific directory:

    - `$HOME/.local/bin`          on Unix.
    - `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts`  on Windows.
    - `$POETRY_HOME/bin`          if $POETRY_HOME is set.

    ```bash frame="none"
    # TODO: check if the `poetry` is actually installed in the path
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # To apply the changes
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Use `Poetry`

    ```bash frame="none"
    poetry --version
    ```

4. Autocompletion
    
    ```bash frame="none"
    poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion
    ```

    :::note
    You may need to restart your shell in order for these changes to take effect.
    :::

5. Update `Poetry` (optional)

    ```bash frame="none"
    poetry self update
    ```

6. Uninstall `Poetry` (optional)

    ```bash frame="none"
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --uninstall
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_UNINSTALL=1 python3 -
    ```
</Steps>
