With giants in the Frontend-Framework world like `React` and `Angular`, `Svelte` the underdog has seen an tremendous growth among the developers and within the community since its inception in 2016.

Take a look at the results of **StateOfJs** survey [here](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/)

:::note
This post assumes that you already have an __GitHub__ account.

GitHub is a cloud based platform, where developers can store, manage and share projects. You can create a free account [here](https://github.com/).
:::

## Create a GitHub Project

After creating a new GitHub account or signing into your account, the __dashboard__ page opens.

By clicking the `New` button, create a new project.

![GitHub - new project](./1_new_project.png)

Enter a project name and the visibilty should be `public`. This is because, for Free account, only "public" projects can publish using __GitHub Pages__.

![GitHub - project details](./2_project_details.png)

### Enable GitHub Pages

In the GitHub project, do the following steps

1. Navigate to `Settings` tab
2. Select `Pages` from the sidebar
3. Make sure under **Source**, `GitHub Actions` is selected

That all you need to do for now.

:::tip
`Pages` also allows the possibility to host it under your domain.

## Setup a svelte project

:::caution[Pre-requisites]

- Have an IDE (eg. `VS Code`) installed.
- The latest LTS version of `NodeJs` and `git` must also be installed in the local machine.

:::

In this post, we are going to look into a basic `Svelte` project and not **SVELTEKIT** based app.

<Steps>
1. Create svelte project.

    ```sh frame="none"
    npm init vite -- test-project
    ```
2. Choose the option `Svelte` and language of your choice, here I have selected `Typescript`.

    ![Svelte project command](./3_svelte_command.png)

3. Exceute the following commands, to check whether the development server starts.

    ```sh frame="none"
    # navigate to the project folder
    cd test-project

    # Install the node modules
    npm install

    # Start the dev server
    npm run dev
    ```
4. The server should be started at http://localhost:5173/

5. Open the project in `VS Code`. The project structure should like this.

    <FileTree>

    - index.html
    - **package.json**
    - package-lock.json
    - node_modules/
      - ...
    - public
      - vite.svg
    - README.md
    - src
      - app.css
      - App.svelte  Starting point for svelte-projects
      - assets
        - svelte.svg
      - lib
        - Counter.svelte
      - main.ts
      - vite-env.d.ts
    - svelte.config.js
    - tsconfig.json
    - tsconfig.node.json
    - vite.config.ts

    </FileTree>

</Steps>
### Update `vite.config.ts` file
```diff title="vite.config.ts" lang="ts"
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import { svelte } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'

  // https://vitejs.dev/config/
  export default defineConfig({
+    base:'svelte-github-pages', // project slug from GitHub
    plugins: [svelte()],
  })
```

### Create workflow file

In order to deploy to GitHub Pages, create a file `deploy.yml` in the folder __.github/workflows__ 

<FileTree>
- .github
  - workflows
    - **deploy.yml**
- index.html
- package.json
- ...
</FileTree>

Copy the following contents into the file.

```yml title="deploy.yml"
name: Deploying Svelte app

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

# Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install and Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: github-pages
          path: dist
          retention-days: 1
      
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        id: deployment
```

## Upload the project

Now save its time to create the initial commit and upload the project to GitHub. Follow the following commands

<Steps>
1. Initialize Git Repo
   ```sh frame="none"
   git init
   ```
2. Add files and write the commit message
   ```sh frame="none"
   git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
   ```
3. Setup the remote origin. Change the URL according to your project.
   ```sh frame="none"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/santhosh2r2/svelte-github-pages.git
   ```
4. Push the commit to remote repository
   ```sh frame="none"
   git push origin main
   ```
</Steps>

### Reviewing GitHub Actions

After the initial commit, go to the project in GitHub website. Under the tab `Actions`, you can see a `1 workflow run`.

A successfully completed job looks like this below. And the website is hosted under https://santhosh2r2.github.io/svelte-github-pages/

![Workflow successfull](./8_workflow_successful.png)

The final website should look below.

![successfully deployed](9_successfully_deployed.png)

:::tip

If you see a white screen, when you navigate to the website, make sure to update `vite.config.ts` file.

Refer [Config file update](#update-viteconfigts-file)

:::

:::caution
**Debugging** is an essentail part of any development. If the worklow has failed, like below, then just click on the worklow to get more details.

![Worklow failed example](./5_workflow_failed.png)

Upon opening the run, it is evident from the third message, that GitHub Pages is not enabled. Refer Section [Enabling GitHub Pages](#enable-github-pages)

![Workflow failed details](./6_workflow_failed_details.png)

After enabling pages, just rerun the job.

## Next steps

Now you have a svelte project deployed in GitHub and made available for everyone. 

Have fun making your next project.

Make sure you dont upload any sensitive information (like passwords, access details, etc.)
