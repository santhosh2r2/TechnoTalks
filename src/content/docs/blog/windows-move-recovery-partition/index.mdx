## Introduction

While adding additional storage after the machine is created, can sometimes be challenging. Especially when the `Extend volume` is greyed out.

## Commands to move the recovery partition

<Steps>

1. Disable the `Windows Recovery Partition`.

    ```sh frame="none"
    reagentc /disable
    ```

2. Use `diskpart` to remove the recovery partition. Open `Command Prompt` with administrator rights and execute the commands below.

    ```sh frame="none"
    #Enter Disk Partition program using the command below.
    diskpart

    list disk

    select disk <disk_nr> # where <disk_nr> is the disk needing the recovery partition removed

    list partition

    select partition <partition_nr>  # where <partition_nr> is the recovery partition

    delete partition override # to force deletion of the recovery partition
    ``` 

3. Expand the disk using Disk Management, leaving ~1024 MB at the end of the drive for recreating the recovery partition

    - Create New Simple Volume for Recovery, 
    - NTFS, 
    - no drive letter

4. Use diskpart to set the recovery partition attributes

    ```sh frame="none"
    list partition

    select partition <partition_nr>  # where <partition_nr> is the new recovery partition
    ```
